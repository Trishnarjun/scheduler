# Interview Scheduler

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This repository is the code for the project: I have forked and cloned from the starter repository, then built upon it to practice my HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and their Node, Express back-end skills.

## Getting Started

1. [Create](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) a new repository using this repository as a template.
2. Clone your repository onto your local device.
3. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
3. Start the web server using the `npm start` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:3000/>.
4. You will need the Scheduler-api to be running; for the data to be saving post refresh.
5. Go to <http://localhost:3000/> in your browser.
